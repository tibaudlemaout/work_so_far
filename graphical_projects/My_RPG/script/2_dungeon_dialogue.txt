Are you the help we were promised ?
//2_NPC_1_1 (Soldier waiting in the mines)
Well even if you aren't we really need capable hands right now.
//2_NPC_1_1 (Soldier waiting in the mines)
Bandits have taken over the mine !
//2_NPC_1_1 (Soldier waiting in the mines)
They are too well equipped for us to overpower them.
//2_NPC_1_1 (Soldier waiting in the mines)
and they are organized to be a random group of bandits.
//2_NPC_1_1 (Soldier waiting in the mines)
Something isn't right about this.
//2_NPC_1_1 (Soldier waiting in the mines)
Help us thin out their numbers.
//2_NPC_1_2 (soldier after defeating 20 mobs)
You are more than we hoped for.
//2_NPC_1_2 (soldier after defeating 20 mobs)
We might be able to take it back if their leader gets taken down.
//2_NPC_1_2 (soldier after defeating 20 mobs)
I've heard he was somewhere deep within the mine.
//2_NPC_1_2 (soldier after defeating 20 mobs)
If you manage to stop him then there is still hope for the miners.
//2_NPC_1_3 (soldier after deafeating bandit leader)
Thank you so much for the help.
//2_NPC_1_3 (soldier after deafeating bandit leader)
You have no idea how many will be able to live through the winter thanks to you.
//2_NPC_1_3 (soldier after deafeating bandit leader)
But with this matter handled, the mayor of Fernsworth might be looking for you.
