Seems like you don't plan on leaving, so why don't you help me out ?
// 1_NPC_1_1 (guard inside the dungeon before bob/mob is killed)
I would need you to kill at least 25 monsters to prove you can be of help.
// 1_NPC_1_1 (guard inside the dungeon before bob/mob is killed)
After that come back to me and I'll give you your next task.

You're not half bad with that weapon of yours.
// 1_NPC_1_2 (guard after defeating 25 mobs)
Allow me to explain the situation we are in a bit more.
// 1_NPC_1_2 (guard after defeating 25 mobs)
After the avalanche monsters started flocking to our trading routes and mines,
// 1_NPC_1_2 (guard after defeating 25 mobs)
It's made doing any kind of trade within ourselves extremey difficult
// 1_NPC_1_2 (guard after defeating 25 mobs)
and since the route to the southern trade post are cut off we are alone 
// 1_NPC_1_2 (guard after defeating 25 mobs)
dealing with this issue.
// 1_NPC_1_2 (guard after defeating 25 mobs)
Now if we want to get control of this mine back,
// 1_NPC_1_2 (guard after defeating 25 mobs)
We need to get rid of the leading monster, he is located northeast of here.
// 1_NPC_1_2 (guard after defeating 25 mobs)
If you manage to get rid of him, it would be a start to fix the situation.
// 1_NPC_1_3 (guard after defeating bob)
You actually went and did it !
// 1_NPC_1_3 (guard after defeating bob)
Hurry back to Fernsworth and give the news, this will be of huge help.
