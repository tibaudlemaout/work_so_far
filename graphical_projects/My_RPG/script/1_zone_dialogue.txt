Oh you must be the new envoy, I had a request for you.

You see, since the avalanche it seems that there are more and more monsters lurking
// 1_NPC_1_3 (traveler near start of zone)
and its making going trade extremely difficult for poorer folks like me.
// 1_NPC_1_4 (traveler near start of zone)
Would you mind helping me by clearing a dozen monsters on the way to Fernsworth ?

Halt ! None may enter the village of ... for now.
// 1_NPC_2_2 (guard of village 2 before deeating bob)
We are currently dealing with a monster problem in the cavern north of here.
// 1_NPC_2_3 (guard of village 2 before deeating bob)
And until that is done, i have my orders. Now scram !
// 1_NPC_2_4 (guard of village 2 after defeating bob)
Well I'll be damned, judging from all that slime on your boots, it was your doing.
// 1_NPC_2_5 (guard of village 2 after defeating bob)
I've gotten word that the slime that resided in the cavern is gone.
// 1_NPC_2_6 (guard of village 2 after defeating bob)
You may now enter Fernsworth.
// 1_NPC_2_7 (guard of village 2 after defeating bob)
And a small word of adive, the village is not doing so well so be careful.
