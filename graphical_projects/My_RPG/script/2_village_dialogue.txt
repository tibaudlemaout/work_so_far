//2_NPC_1_1 (mayor first time entering the village)
Yes ?
//2_NPC_1_1 (mayor first time entering the village)
Ah, you must be the envoy from Favorsham, I received a letter regarding your arrival
//2_NPC_1_1 (mayor first time entering the village)
You see, the avalanche has cut us off from the South,
//2_NPC_1_1 (mayor first time entering the village)
and the mayor of Sherfield Keep has been using it to his advantage.
//2_NPC_1_1 (mayor first time entering the village)
He used the commotion to take over our mines,
//2_NPC_1_1 (mayor first time entering the village)
and with communication with the authorities impossible, we are powerless.
//2_NPC_1_1 (mayor first time entering the village)
Go see our Guard Captain if you wish to help.
//2_NPC_1_2 (mayor, after bandit leader)
Oho, I was right to ask your help in this matter.
//2_NPC_1_2 (mayor, after bandit leader)
Before I reveal more to you I would need you to talk with the inhabitants.
//2_NPC_1_2 (mayor, after bandit leader)
It's just so you get an idea of the situation. 
//2_NPC_2_1 (Guard Captain (first time meeting him)
I've heard of you, you defeated the slime in the cavern, thank you again.
//2_NPC_2_1 (Guard Captain (first time meeting him)
But you are here on the mayor's order I assume ?
//2_NPC_2_1 (Guard Captain (first time meeting him)
Great, but be warned there are bandits running amok on the way to the Keep.
//2_NPC_2_1 (Guard Captain (first time meeting him)
If you could deal with some of them it would help us try and reclaim the mine.
//2_NPC_2_1 (Guard Captain (first time meeting him)
Once you've defeated about 15 of them, go talk to my second,
//2_NPC_2_1 (Guard Captain (first time meeting him)
He should be near the mine entrance.
//2_NPC_3_1 (villager on the main plaza)
Oh, you are the envoy from Favorsham.
//2_NPC_3_1 (villager on the main plaza)
It's great to see our villages help eachother in those difficult times.
//2_NPC_4_1 (villager on the main plaza)
Now that the bandits have fled, I might finally be able to go back to work.
//2_NPC_4_1 (villager on the main plaza)
I am a miner and since this mine is the main income of this village,
//2_NPC_4_1 (villager on the main plaza)
you have no idea how much this will help us local folk.
//2_NPC_5_1 (villager near exit house)
It's still weird to me.
//2_NPC_5_1 (villager near exit house)
The bandits came from nowhere and only too over this mine,
//2_NPC_5_1 (villager near exit house)
they didn't even bother stealing some of the ore.
//2_NPC_5_1 (villager near exit house)
hmmm, something is not adding up here.
//2_NPC_6_1 (villager on the smaller plaza)
Oh another new face. Are you here to join the guards ?
//2_NPC_6_1 (villager on the smaller plaza)
There has been a lot of new faces amongst the guards, i can't get used to it.
//2_NPC_7_1 (villager on the smaller plaza)
With the trade route cut off, the options to make a living are few.
//2_NPC_7_1 (villager on the smaller plaza)
But i've heard that the ones in Sherfield Keep are doing well.
//2_NPC_8_1 (villager near the mayor's house)
I've lost contact with my family back in Sherfield Keep.
//2_NPC_8_1 (villager near the mayor's house)
I wonder why.
//2_NPC_8_1 (villager near the mayor's house)
I hope nothing bad happened to them.
//2_NPC_9_1 (villager near top left house)
I've seen you asking around how life is here.
//2_NPC_9_1 (villager near top left house)
As you might have heard it's pretty tough, but Sherfield Keep,
//2_NPC_9_1 (villager near top left house)
As you  might know is the largest settlement here in the North,
//2_NPC_9_1 (villager near top left house)
is doing just fine yet they refuse to help us in anyway.
