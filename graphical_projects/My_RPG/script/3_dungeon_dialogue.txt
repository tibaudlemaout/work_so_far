Well what do we have here ?
//3_NPC_3_1 (The Mayor before first fight)
I suppose you don't know any better than to meddle in my affairs.
//3_NPC_3_1 (The Mayor before first fight)
I do not know what you hope to achieve here, but it is futile.
//3_NPC_3_1 (The Mayor before first fight)
Now begone with you !
//3_NPC_3_2 (The Mayor after fight 1)
Hmph . . .

You do have some skills, I will grant you that.
//3_NPC_3_2 (The Mayor after fight 1)
Unfortunately for you, the world is much larger than our small province.
//3_NPC_3_2 (The Mayor after fight 1)
You wouldn't even understand if I tried to explain it.
//3_NPC_3_2 (The Mayor after fight 1)
But I can show you.

//3_NPC_3_3 (The Mayor after fight 2)

//3_NPC_3_3 (The Mayor after fight 2)
But no matter, I might have failed here,
//3_NPC_3_3 (The Mayor after fight 2)
But I am but one of many.
//3_NPC_3_3 (The Mayor after fight 2)
You will see in due time,

How use...less your fi..ght i....s
