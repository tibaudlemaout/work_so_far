You haven't done evrything the chief asked you to do yet, come back when that's done.
//1_NPC_1_1(chief)
Good Morning $(name), I've got a task for you today !
//1_NPC_1_1(chief)
But first I need you to get some basic supplies from our blacksmith.
//1_NPC_2_1(blacksmith)
Ah here you are ! The chief told me you would be coming over to pick this up.
//1_NPC_2_2(blacksmith)
The rest is with the armorer.
//1_NPC_3(armorer)
Yes, yes, the goods are here now leave me be, I still have quite the worload today.
//1_NPC_1_2(chief)
I see that you've retrieved my gifts to you, if you could talk to the guard,
//1_NPC_1_3(chief)
he'll handle the rest of you're preparations.
//1_NPC_4_2(guard)
Now that you are well equipped, follow me. I've got a couple of things to show you.
//1_NPC_4_3(guard)
You can bet you will always find monsters in there so be careful.
//1_NPC_4_4(guard)
I'll be waiting by the village road when you feel ready.
//1_NPC_4_5(guard)
To mare sure you're capable for the tasks ahead,
//1_NPC_4_6(guard)
draw that sword and show me what you've got.
//1_NPC_4_7(guard)
That was pretty good, not as good as me when I was your age but good enough.
//1_NPC_4_8(guard)
You may proceed.
