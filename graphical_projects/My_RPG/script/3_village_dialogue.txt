Stop !
//3_NPC_1_1 (guard near the main building)
The Keep is currently closed as requested by the Mayor.
//3_NPC_1_1 (guard near the main building)
You may wander around town but no audiance will be granted.
//3_NPC_2_1 (another guard near the exit to the Keep)
Didn't any guard tell you ? The Keep is closed for now.
//3_NPC_2_1 (another guard near the exit to the Keep)
Now get away from here, nothing to look at.
//3_NPC_3_1 (a villager near the bottom left of the town)
Hey. Over here.
//3_NPC_3_1 (a villager near the bottom left of the town)
I saw that you tried to get to the Keep. The main path is closed but . .
//3_NPC_3_1 (a villager near the bottom left of the town)
I know a way around the main path.
//3_NPC_3_1 (a villager near the bottom left of the town)
You need to stick to the right wall and go straight north.
//3_NPC_3_1 (a villager near the bottom left of the town)
You should be able to get past all the guards that way.
